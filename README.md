#Abstracted
*Designed and created by Kevin Weber // August 2013*

*Abstracted* is a concept that uses art to display time.


###To Read
*Hours* are the large horizontal black bars. They act as tally marks (4 bars = 4 hours past 12, 5 bars = 5 hours past 12). Hours will count, starting from the top of the screen, up to 11, and at 12 will reset to 0 (0 hours past 12).

--
*Minutes* are the thin diagonal stripes on the left side. They too act as tally marks, counting up to 59 and at 60/0 will reset to 0. They will fill up from the bottom of the screen to the black triangle in the corner.

--
*PM* is represented by the large grey shade on the bottom right of the screen. If it is there, it is PM, if it is not, it is AM.

*Note: Abstracted is in 12hr format only.*

--
The black triangle at the top serves multiple functions.
- As a design element
- As a visual aid to know when minutes stop. This is because the minute lines are spaced out by a specific amount of pixels. If spaced out by one more pixel, the bars go off-screen, uncountable. This current spacing does not fill up the entire screeen, and therefore, without a visual aid, seem to end abruptly.
- At a later time, I may add a version with a date number that goes here.
